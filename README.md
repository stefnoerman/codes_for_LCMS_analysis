# codes_for_LCMS_analysis
> [!NOTE]
> This repo is made to compile all the R scripts I wrote to visualize and analyze MS1 and MS2 data.

Here are the list of scripts I would like to include in this repo:


> [!IMPORTANT]
> All vendor-generated files need to first be converted to .mzML files.

> [!TIP]
> Conversion of raw files to .mzML files can be performed using [![MSConvert](https://img.shields.io/badge/proteowizard-msconvert-blue)](https://example.org), either using GUI or in R with provided script.

> [!WARNING]
> All the scripts were written for R. Please use the latest version of R, RStudio, and libraries to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> In case you find some bugs with the script, please try to fix it at your clone and let me know when it is ready ^_^.
